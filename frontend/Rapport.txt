Interface Implementation
	API Communication:
	 	The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful API calls using Axios. The application has a structured service layer    thathandles all API interactions:

	 Service modules like {authService.js}, {userService.js}, and {taskService.js} use this base configuration to make specific API calls, maintaining a clean separation of concerns.
	
	Main Pages/Components:
		1-Authentication Pages:
			Login page with credential validation
			Multi-step registration process (basic info → profile details → strategy selection → payment)
		
		2-User Interface:
			User dashboard for displaying today tasks and the coming task
			Task tracker showing upcoming, completed, and missed tasks
			Performance analytics with visual representations
			Calendar view for scheduled activities
			
		3-Admin Interface:
			User management sections (new, active, inactive, resubscribed users)
			Strategy assignment for individual users (general or monthly)
			Performance metrics and statistics
			
		4-User Profile:
			User basic Information
			Subscription management
			Strategy management
		
	Routing/Navigation:
	The application uses React Router for navigation with protected routes for authenticated sections:

	Dynamic Content Rendering using React hooks:
	The application dynamically updates its UI using useState and useEffect, ensuring a responsive interface based on
		User authentication status
		User role (admin vs. regular user)
		Subscription status
		Task completion status
		
	State Management:
	Redux is used for global state management with dedicated slices for different concerns:
			{authSlice}: Handles authentication state, login/logout actions
			{userSlice}: Manages user profile and subscription data
			{tasksSlice}: Tracks user tasks and related statistics
			{adminSlice}: Handles admin-specific state (when applicable)

	Client-Side Implementation
		Form Validation: Implemented comprehensive client-side validation for all forms (login, registration, profile updates) with appropriate error messages
		Form Controls: Used controlled components for form inputs with proper state management
		Notifications: Implemented toast notifications for success/error messages using a custom notification system
		Loading States: Added loading indicators during API calls to improve user experience
		Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling for API calls with user-friendly error messages
Testing
	Testing Approach
		Manual Testing:
			Functional testing of all features (login, registration, task management)
			Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
			User flow testing for common scenarios
			Automated Testing (planned):
			Unit tests for utility functions and Redux reducers
			Component tests for key UI components
			Integration tests for critical user flows
			
		Responsive Design Testing:
			The application was tested across multiple device sizes:
			Mobile (320px-480px): Verified navigation, form submission, and content display
			Tablet (768px-1024px): Tested layout adjustments and touch interactions
			Desktop (1024px+): Validated full feature set and optimal layout
			
		Responsive design was implemented using:
			Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
			Media queries for breakpoint-specific styling
			Relative units (rem, %, vh/vw) for scalable components
			Mobile-first approach for CSS implementation
			The application adapts its UI components, navigation, and content display based on the device size to ensure optimal user experience across all platforms.
